            Establish clear and transparent underwriting criteria: We also
            understand that small businesses lenders often have limited credit
            history and collateral. Therefore, we establish clear and
            transparent underwriting criteria that take into account a variety
            of factors such as cash flow, business experience, and personal
            credit, to ensure that the lending process is fair and objective.

            Implement a robust loan management system: To ensure the loans are
            well managed, we implement a robust loan management system that
            tracks loans, manages risk, and ensures compliance with regulations.
            This includes tools for loan origination, credit scoring, and loan
            servicing.
